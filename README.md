Git Repository and the main Release Flow.
Create a new repository in your Git version control provider (e.g. Github, Bitbucket, GitLab, others).
Commit the example .gitignore file in the master branch to avoid tracking unnecessary files and thus keeping your branches with only necessary files.
Create a Git Repository record in Copado. 
A Git Repository represents the repository, it's authentication, and some settings for e.g. committing or creating Pull Requests from user stories and promotions.
If your Git Repository is behind a firewall, enable internet access to the HTTPS URI of the Git Repository for Copado to access it.
