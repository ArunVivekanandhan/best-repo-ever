Creating/resetting an API Key
Click on the Account Summary tab
Press the sub-tab called, "API Key".
Press the "Create / Reset" button. A new API key will be created and shown below. Resetting the API Key will disable existing webhooks running on that key. Note: you should make a note of where the API keys are used (if outside of Copado) to ensure reset tokens can be changed in all locations.
